# Pipeliam-Maya
A pipeline built in Maya for optimisation performance

Built with python 3.14 - PySide and QT Designer


USING OF THE PIPELIAM Alpha v0.1 : 

To make the pipeliam open at maya's start, please put the userSetup.py in : $MAYA_DIR$\2022(or Higher)\scripts or copy the code inside the userSetup.py and place it in yours
If you just want to launch it manually, please copy the code in userSetup.py and place it in you script editor

Global -->

PLEASE USE MAYA 2022 to test it.

I created a folder tree that is based on the ESMA-Lyon folder tree
You can find it at : $PATH_TO_PIPELIAM$/media/folder_base

If you need to change stuff for your own folder tree make sure to keep the global names and hierarchy

The menu button at the top left will give you access to all the pages.
